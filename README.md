ToDo list:
- [x] FCA Part
- [x] PAC Learning
  - [x] Implement the dataset sampler
  - [x] Complete the approx-equivalent function
  - [x] Implement HORN1
- [ ] Regex Learning
  - [ ] Without POS
  - [ ] Incorporate POS information for potential regex conflicts for different
        clusters
- [ ] Evaluation
  - [x] Simple overlapping words evaluation
  - [ ] Original task metric (would require to implement regex)
- [x] Make automated pipeline for the entire dataset and get cumulative results
- [ ] Modulify the code
  - [ ] Change directory structure
  - [ ] Add tests
  - [ ] Add usage documentation
